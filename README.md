# Material-UI Proof of Concept
A simple proof of concept for a React application built with the Material-UI library and Redux state container.

### Main Technologies
* React v16.8
* Material-UI v4.2
* Redux v4.0

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
1) You need to have Node/NPM installed on your machine;
2) You also need to install the json-server NPM package (`npm i -g json-server`).

### Usage
1) On the project root folder, run the command `npm run start`;
2) Navigate to the folder `\json-server` and run the command `json-server db.json` (this is the mocked back-end);
3) That's it, access http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Live Demo
If in a first attempt the application fails to load showing an **application error page**, please try refreshing the browser since the Heroku plataform put applications to sleep after some time of inactivity. The second request should work wihtout any problem.
